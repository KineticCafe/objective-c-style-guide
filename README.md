# Kinetic Cafe Objective-C Style Guide

This is work-in-progress style guide for iOS teams in Kinetic Cafe Inc. 

## Introduction

Here are some of the documents from Apple that informed the style guide. If something isn’t mentioned here, it’s probably covered in great detail in one of these:

* [The Objective-C Programming Language](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Introduction/introObjectiveC.html)
* [Cocoa Fundamentals Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/Introduction/Introduction.html)
* [Coding Guidelines for Cocoa](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/CodingGuidelines.html)
* [iOS App Programming Guide](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/iphone/conceptual/iphoneosprogrammingguide/Introduction/Introduction.html)

## Code Organization

* `init` and `dealloc` should always be placed at the top of the implementation
* Use `#pragma mark -` to categorize methods in functional groupings and protocol/delegate implementations following this general structure.

```objc
#pragma mark - Static Methods
#pragma mark - Lifecycle

- (instancetype)init {}
- (void)dealloc {}

// If this object conforms to NSCopying
#pragma mark - NSCopying

- (id)copyWithZone:(NSZone *)zone {}

// If this overrides `NSObject`'s `description` method
#pragma mark - NSObject

- (NSString *)description {}

// If this object is a UIViewController subclass
#pragma mark - View Lifecycle

- (void)viewDidLoad {}
- (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated {}
- (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning {}

#pragma mark - Overriding Methods

- (void)setParentProperty:(id)value {}
- (id)parentProperty {}

// If this is a `UIView` subclass
#pragma mark - Views

- (UIView *)lazyLoadedView {}

#pragma mark - Public

- (void)publicMethod {}

#pragma mark - Private

- (void)privateMethod {}

#pragma mark - Protocols conformance
#pragma mark - Pragma for each delegate
```

## Spacing

### Indentation

* **Indent using 4 spaces. Never indent with tabs.** Be sure to set this preference in Xcode.
* Method braces and other braces (`if`/`else`/`switch`/`while` etc.) always open on the same line as the statement but close on a new line.
* One whitespace before the parenthesis, no space inside parenthesis

**For example:**

```objc
if (user.isHappy) {
    // Do something
}
else {
    // Do something else
}
```
### Line Break and Whitespace

* There should be exactly one blank line between methods to aid in visual clarity and organization.
* Whitespace within methods should be used to separate functionality (though often this can indicate an opportunity to split the method into several, smaller methods). In methods with long or verbose names, a single line of whitespace may be used to provide visual separation before the method’s body.

**For example**

```objc
- (void)initWithUser:(User *)newUser firstname:(NSString *)firstname lastname:(NSString *)lastname;
```

* `@synthesize` and `@dynamic` should each be declared on new lines in the implementation.

### Alignment

* Align "=" signs within the same code block


## Naming

Apple naming conventions should be adhered to wherever possible, especially those related to [memory management rules](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/MemoryMgmt.html) ([NARC](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2865194/340508)).

Long, descriptive method and variable names are good.

**For example:**

```objc
UIButton *settingsButton;
```

**Not**

```objc
UIButton *setBut;
```

### Methods

Methods should not contain conjunction words, but tersely describe the parameters.

**For example:**

```objc
- (void)initWithUser:(User *)newUser firstname:(NSString *)firstname lastname:(NSString *)lastname;
```

**Not**

```objc
- (void)initWithUser:(User *)newUser forFirstname:(NSString *)firstname andLastname:(NSString *)lastname;
```


### Variables

Variables should be named descriptively, with the variable’s name clearly communicating what the variable _is_ and pertinent information a programmer needs to use that value properly.

**For example:**

* `NSString *title`: It is reasonable to assume a “title” is a string.
* `NSString *titleHTML`: This indicates a title that may contain HTML which needs parsing for display. _“HTML” is needed for a programmer to use this variable effectively._
* `NSAttributedString *titleAttributedString`: A title, already formatted for display. _`AttributedString` hints that this value is not just a vanilla title, and adding it could be a reasonable choice depending on context._
* `NSDate *now`: _No further clarification is needed._
* `NSDate *lastModifiedDate`: Simply `lastModified` can be ambiguous; depending on context, one could reasonably assume it is one of a few different types.
* `NSURL *URL` vs. `NSString *URLString`: In situations when a value can reasonably be represented by different classes, it is often useful to disambiguate in the variable’s name.
* `NSString *releaseDateString`: Another example where a value could be represented by another class, and the name can help disambiguate.

Single letter variable names should be avoided except as simple counter variables in loops.

Asterisks indicating a type is a pointer should be “attached to” the variable name. **For example,** `NSString *text` **not** `NSString* text` or `NSString * text`, except in the case of constants (`NSString * const NYTConstantString`).

### Constants

Constants are preferred over in-line string literals or numbers, as they allow for easy reproduction of commonly used variables and can be quickly changed without the need for find and replace. Constants should be declared as `static` constants and not `#define`s unless explicitly being used as a macro.

**For example:**

```objc
static NSString * const KCPAboutViewControllerCompanyName = @"Kinetic Cafe Inc.";

static const CGFloat KCPImageThumbnailHeight = 50.0;
```

**Not:**

```objc
#define CompanyName @"Kinetic Cafe Inc."

#define thumbnailHeight 2
```

### Prefix

* A three letter prefix (e.g., `KCP`) should always be used for class names and constants. Constants should be camel-case with all words capitalized and prefixed by the related class name for clarity. A two letter prefix (e.g., `NS`) is [reserved for use by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/DefiningClasses/DefiningClasses.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011210-CH3-SW12).
* Constant name should follow the format of `<filename>constantName`

**For example:**

```objc
static const NSTimeInterval KCPNavigationViewControllerNavigationFadeAnimationDuration = 0.3;
```

**Not:**

```objc
static const NSTimeInterval fadetime = 1.7;
```

* Properties and local variables should be camel-case with the leading word being lowercase.
* Instance variables should be camel-case with the leading word being lowercase, and should be prefixed with an underscore. This is consistent with instance variables synthesized automatically by LLVM. **If LLVM can synthesize the variable automatically, then let it.**

**For example:**

```objc
@synthesize descriptiveVariableName = _descriptiveVariableName;
```

**Not:**

```objc
id varnm;
```

* Enum name should be a prefix of the variable names

**Example:**

```objc
typedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, KCPStoryType) {
    KCPStoryTypeOld,
    KCPStoryTypeNew
};
```

### Categories

Categories may be used to concisely segment functionality and should be named to describe that functionality.

**For example:**

```objc
@interface UIViewController (KCPAutoHideNavBar)
@interface NSString (NSStringEncodingDetection)
```

**Not:**

```objc
@interface KCPModel (private)
@interface NSString (KCPRelative)
```

Methods and properties added in categories should be named with an app- or organization-specific prefix. This avoids unintentionally overriding an existing method, and it reduces the chance of two categories from different libraries adding a method of the same name. (The Objective-C runtime doesn’t specify which method will be called in the latter case, which can lead to unintended effects.)

**For example:**

```objc
@interface NSArray (KCPAccessors)
- (id)kcp_objectOrNilAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index;
@end
```

**Not:**

```objc
@interface NSArray (KCPAccessors)
- (id)objectOrNilAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index;
@end
```


## Properties

Properties should be camel-case with the leading word being lowercase. Use auto-synthesis for properties rather than manual @synthesize statements unless you have good reason.

### Private Properties

Private properties should be declared in class extensions (anonymous categories) in the implementation file of a class.

**For example:**

```objc
@interface KCPRepository ()

@property (nonatomic, strong) UIView *topView;
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIView *bannerView;
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIWebView *webView;

@end
```

### Dot Notation Syntax

Dot notation should **always** be used for accessing and mutating properties. Bracket notation is preferred in all other instances.

**For example:**

```objc
view.backgroundColor = [UIColor orangeColor];
[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;
```

**Not:**

```objc
[view setBackgroundColor:[UIColor orangeColor]];
UIApplication.sharedApplication.delegate;
```

### Underscores

When using properties, instance variables should always be accessed and mutated using `self.`. This means that all properties will be visually distinct, as they will all be prefaced with `self.`. 

An exception to this: inside initializers, the backing instance variable (i.e. `_variableName`) should be used directly to avoid any potential side effects of the getters/setters.

Local variables should not contain underscores.

**For example:**

```objc
@interface KCPSection: NSObject

- (instancetype)initWithHeadline:(NSString *)headline;
@property (nonatomic) NSString *headline;

@end

@implementation KCPSection

- (instancetype)initWithHeadline:(NSString *)headline {
	self = [super init];
	if (self) {
		_headline = headline;
	}
	
	return self;
}

@end
```

**Not:**

```objc
@interface KCPSection : NSObject {
    NSString *headline;
}
```

## Methods

### Syntax

In method signatures, there should be a space after the method type (-/+ symbol). There should be a space between the method segments (matching Apple's style).  Always include a keyword and be descriptive with the word before the argument which describes the argument.

The usage of the word "and" is reserved.  It should not be used for multiple parameters as illustrated in the `initWithWidth:height:` example below.

**Preferred:**

```objc
- (void)setExampleText:(NSString *)text image:(UIImage *)image;
- (void)sendAction:(SEL)aSelector to:(id)anObject forAllCells:(BOOL)flag;
- (id)viewWithTag:(NSInteger)tag;
- (instancetype)initWithWidth:(CGFloat)width height:(CGFloat)height;
```

**Not Preferred:**

```objc
-(void)setT:(NSString *)text i:(UIImage *)image;
- (void)sendAction:(SEL)aSelector :(id)anObject :(BOOL)flag;
- (id)taggedView:(NSInteger)tag;
- (instancetype)initWithWidth:(CGFloat)width andHeight:(CGFloat)height;
- (instancetype)initWith:(int)width and:(int)height;  // Never do this.
```

### Ternary Operator

The ternary operator, `?` , should only be used when it increases clarity or code neatness. A single condition is usually all that should be evaluated. Evaluating multiple conditions is usually more understandable as an if statement, or refactored into named variables.

**For example:**

```objc
result = a > b ? x : y;
```

**Not:**

```objc
result = a > b ? x = c > d ? c : d : y;
```

### Golden Path

When coding with conditionals, the left hand margin of the code should be the "golden" or "happy" path.  That is, don't nest `if` statements.  Multiple return statements are OK.

**Preferred:**

```objc
- (void)someMethod {
  if (![someOther boolValue]) {
	return;
  }

  //Do something important
}
```

**Not Preferred:**

```objc
- (void)someMethod {
  if ([someOther boolValue]) {
    //Do something important
  }
}
```

### Conditionals

Conditional bodies should always use braces even when a conditional body could be written without braces (e.g., it is one line only) to prevent [errors](https://github.com/NYTimes/objective-c-style-guide/issues/26#issuecomment-22074256). These errors include adding a second line and expecting it to be part of the if-statement. Another, [even more dangerous defect](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/16530) may happen where the line “inside” the if-statement is commented out, and the next line unwittingly becomes part of the if-statement. In addition, this style is more consistent with all other conditionals, and therefore more easily scannable.

**For example:**

```objc
if (!error) {
    return success;
}
```

**Not:**

```objc
if (!error)
    return success;
```

or

```objc
if (!error) return success;
```

### Error Handling

When methods return an error parameter by reference, switch on the returned value, not the error variable.

**For example:**

```objc
NSError *error;
if (![self trySomethingWithError:&error]) {
    // Handle Error
}
```

**Not:**

```objc
NSError *error;
[self trySomethingWithError:&error];
if (error) {
    // Handle Error
}
```

Some of Apple’s APIs write garbage values to the error parameter (if non-NULL) in successful cases, so switching on the error can cause false negatives (and subsequently crash).


## Protocols

In a [delegate or data source protocol](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/CocoaEncyclopedia/DelegatesandDataSources/DelegatesandDataSources.html), the first parameter to each method should be the object sending the message.

This helps disambiguate in cases when an object is the delegate for multiple similarly-typed objects, and it helps clarify intent to readers of a class implementing these delegate methods.

**For example:**

```objc
- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;
```

**Not:**

```objc
- (void)didSelectTableRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;
```


## Variables

### Literals

`NSString`, `NSDictionary`, `NSArray`, and `NSNumber` literals should be used whenever creating immutable instances of those objects. Pay special care that `nil` values not be passed into `NSArray` and `NSDictionary` literals, as this will cause a crash.

**For example:**

```objc
NSArray *names = @[@"Brian", @"Matt", @"Chris", @"Alex", @"Steve", @"Paul"];
NSDictionary *productManagers = @{@"iPhone" : @"Kate", @"iPad" : @"Kamal", @"Mobile Web" : @"Bill"};
NSNumber *shouldUseLiterals = @YES;
NSNumber *buildingZIPCode = @10018;
```

**Not:**

```objc
NSArray *names = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Brian", @"Matt", @"Chris", @"Alex", @"Steve", @"Paul", nil];
NSDictionary *productManagers = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: @"Kate", @"iPhone", @"Kamal", @"iPad", @"Bill", @"Mobile Web", nil];
NSNumber *shouldUseLiterals = [NSNumber numberWithBool:YES];
NSNumber *buildingZIPCode = [NSNumber numberWithInteger:10018];
```

### `CGRect` Functions

When accessing the `x`, `y`, `width`, or `height` of a `CGRect`, always use the [`CGGeometry` functions](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/graphicsimaging/reference/CGGeometry/Reference/reference.html) instead of direct struct member access. From Apple's `CGGeometry` reference:

> All functions described in this reference that take CGRect data structures as inputs implicitly standardize those rectangles before calculating their results. For this reason, your applications should avoid directly reading and writing the data stored in the CGRect data structure. Instead, use the functions described here to manipulate rectangles and to retrieve their characteristics.

**For example:**

```objc
CGRect frame = self.view.frame;

CGFloat x = CGRectGetMinX(frame);
CGFloat y = CGRectGetMinY(frame);
CGFloat width = CGRectGetWidth(frame);
CGFloat height = CGRectGetHeight(frame);
```

**Not:**

```objc
CGRect frame = self.view.frame;

CGFloat x = frame.origin.x;
CGFloat y = frame.origin.y;
CGFloat width = frame.size.width;
CGFloat height = frame.size.height;
```

### Booleans

Never compare something directly to `YES`, because `YES` is defined as `1`, and a `BOOL` in Objective-C is a `CHAR` type that is 8 bits long (so a value of `11111110` will return `NO` if compared to `YES`).

**For an object pointer:**

```objc
if (!someObject) {
}

if (someObject == nil) {
}
```

**For a `BOOL` value:**

```objc
if (isAwesome)
if (!someNumber.boolValue)
if (someNumber.boolValue == NO)
```

**Not:**

```objc
if (isAwesome == YES) // Never do this.
```

If the name of a `BOOL` property is expressed as an adjective, the property’s name can omit the `is` prefix but should specify the conventional name for the getter.

**For example:**

```objc
@property (assign, getter=isEditable) BOOL editable;
```


## Enumeration Types

When using `enum`s, use the new fixed underlying type specification, which provides stronger type checking and code completion. The SDK includes a macro to facilitate and encourage use of fixed underlying types: `NS_ENUM()`.

**Example:**

```objc
typedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, KCPUserState) {
    KCPUserStateNotSignedIn,
    KCPUserStateSignedIn
};
```

## Bitmasks

When working with bitmasks, use the `NS_OPTIONS` macro.

**Example:**

```objc
typedef NS_OPTIONS(NSUInteger, KCPCategory) {
   	KCPCategoryFootwears    = 1 << 0,
    KCPCategoryHandbags     = 1 << 1,
    KCPCategoryAccessories  = 1 << 2,
    KCPCategoryRandom		 = 1 << 3
};
```

## Singletons

* Singleton objects should use a thread-safe pattern for creating their shared instance.
* The naming of the singleton variable should be clear instead of using a generic "sharedInstance" for all cases. For example, sharedManager, standardApplication. 

```objc

static id _sharedManager = nil;

//Some code

+ (instancetype)sharedManager {

    static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
    dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{
        _sharedManager = [[[self class] alloc] init];
    });

    return _sharedManager;
}
```

## Comments

When they are needed, comments should be used to explain **why** a particular piece of code does something. Any comments that are used must be kept up-to-date or deleted.

Block comments should generally be avoided, as code should be as self-documenting as possible, with only the need for intermittent, few-line explanations. This does not apply to those comments used to generate documentation.


## Xcode project

The physical files should be kept in sync with the Xcode project files in order to avoid file sprawl. **Any Xcode groups created should be reflected by folders in the filesystem.** Code should be grouped not only by type, but also by feature for greater clarity.

When possible, always turn on “Treat Warnings as Errors” in the target’s Build Settings and enable as many [additional warnings](http://boredzo.org/blog/archives/2009-11-07/warnings) as possible. If you need to ignore a specific warning, use [Clang’s pragma feature](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#controlling-diagnostics-via-pragmas).
